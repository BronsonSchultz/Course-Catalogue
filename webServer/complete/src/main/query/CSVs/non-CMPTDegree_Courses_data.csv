MATH,104,Elementary Calculus,"An elementary introduction to calculus including functions, limits, derivatives, techniques of differentiation, curve sketching and maximum and minimum problems, antiderivatives and the integral."
MATH,121,Mathematical Analysis for Business and Economics,"An introduction to mathematics for business and economics students using examples from business to motivate mathematical techniques. Necessary mathematical terms and concepts are developed, but emphasis is on applications to business with sufficient theory to support applications. Topics: algebraic functions, mathematics of finance, analysis of functions, differential and integral calculus."
MATH,123,Calculus I for Engineers,"A review of basic algebraic concepts, trigonometry and functions. An introduction to limits and differential and integral calculus, max-min problems, curve sketching, related rate problems. Specifically for students in the College of Engineering."
MATH,125,Mathematics for the Life Sciences,"An introduction to mathematical modeling with a focus on applications to the life sciences. Topics include: algebraic functions and their graphs, limits and rates of change, differentiation techniques and applications, exponential and logarithmic functions, integration and the area under a curve, introduction to differential equations. The main feature of this course is the use of structured examples from life sciences to establish a need for mathematical techniques. Necessary mathematical terms and concepts will be developed. The emphasis throughout this course is on applications of mathematics to life sciences with enough theory to support applications. Extensive examples from Biology, Health Sciences, Chemistry and Physics will be used."
